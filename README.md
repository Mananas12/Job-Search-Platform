JobSearchPlatform is a simple console-based job search application developed in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The goal of the project is to simulate a job search platform where users can browse job listings, filter vacancies, and manage their own profile.

Features

Job Listings:

    • Add new job vacancies with details such as title, salary, required experience, and description.

    • View all available job listings in a structured format.

Filtering Options:

    • Filter job listings by salary range, required experience, or specific keywords.

User Profile:

    • Create and edit your own job seeker profile with personal information and job preferences.

Validation System:

    • Input data is validated using descriptors to ensure proper formats and values.

Organized OOP Code Structure:

    • Clean object-oriented design with separate classes for job listings, user profiles, and filtering logic.

Installation

    Install Python 3.x from https://www.python.org

How to Run

    python main.py

Educational Note

This project was created as a learning exercise to practice Object-Oriented Programming principles in Python. It focuses on:

  • Abstraction with abstract base classes

  • Encapsulation with private and protected attributes

  • Descriptors for data validation

  • Interfaces for a scalable project structure
